Space Marines: 
Adeptus Astartes (colloquial: Space Marines) are genetically modified superhuman soldiers, the elite warriors of the Imperium of Man. During the late 30th millennium AD, the Emperor uses the Space Marine Legions to conquer the human-inhabited worlds of the galaxy, uniting them in the Imperium of Man and reuniting the Primarchs with their Legions.

"They shall be my finest warriors, these men who give of themselves to me. Like clay I shall mould them, and in the furnace of war forge them. They will be of iron will and steely muscle. In great armour shall I clad them and with the mightiest guns will they be armed. They will be untouched by plague or disease, no sickness will blight them. They will have tactics, strategies and machines so that no foe can best them in battle. They are my bulwark against the Terror. They are the Defenders of Humanity. They are my Space Marines and they shall know no fear."

– The God-Emperor of Mankind

Orks:
Orks revel in violence for its own sake; their entire culture revolves around warfare. They are one of the oldest, most widespread and persistent of the Imperium's enemies and even outnumber the quadrillions strong humanity as a species, making them the most numerous species in the galaxy. Their simplistic personalities, reckless tactics and ramshackle technology make them rather dangerous in large numbers.

Terrain:
Anulure was once a powerful kingdom set on a planet in far corners of the universe. Being on the borders of several empires throughout the centuries, it was constantly ravaged by countless conflicts and then rebuilt, until it was completely destroyed by the last crusade of God Emperor, leaving nothing but ashes on the surface of the entire planet. Today, the God Emperor returns to add just a little bit to the mountainous piles of ashes.

As the name suggests, this planet is nothing but a junkyard for various „technological advancement“ equipment that grew obsolete the moment it left the production lines. Once a weapon supplier for the entire galaxy, now it is a home to a few eccentric economy graduates who keep trying to „fix“ the planet by finding cheaper ways to produce more junk.

Many a traveler got lost on this side of the galaxy and ended up on this planet, looking for any kind of civilization. Unfortunately, it never harbored any civilization of note, at least not on the surface. And no one yet came back to tell the tale of what happens under the surface once they got swallowed by one of many quicksand pits that covered the planet.

The name of this planet is kind of ironic, considering there is nothing on it but sand. However, the advice it tries to give you is sound, for the sandlions – terrible snake-like beasts with elbow-long teeth – do not discriminate between Space Marines and Orks. If you are stepping on their sands, you are bound to attend a lunch that will last you a lifetime. Which is to say, it will not be very long.

Even to this day, this planet is avoided in a wide arc due to the rumours - rumours that were mostly true. It is covered in incredibly tall, dark trees, creating a forest that didn't begin nor end. And in that forest, something was prowling, so any kind of exploration quickly came to an abrupt stop, with unfortunate explorers eternally lost in the woods.

It's just a jungle. Planet-wide, green and uninteresting. Lost of vines and trees and plants and flowers. Nothing else but that.

Beautiful blue-green color of the swamps on the first look seems quite inviting, but they hid a terrible secret - the area used to be dotted with meadows where the locals grew enough food for the entire planet. However, the planet was in the way of the God Emperor's crusade; with a terrible weapon he aimed at the planet, he raised the temperature of the atmosphere so much that the polar ice caps melted and the water covered everything - including the residents.

Rumour has it that even the first race - the so-called humans of the planet Earth - descended from apes, an animal type central to Earth, with long, hairy arms and unusual love for a type of yellow fruit. Thus we got the term "ape-like", which is a perfect word to describe creatures that roamed tall trees of Nozama Woods, jumping from branch to branch and swinging on vines... and, only occasionally, bashing the brains in of an unsuspecting tourist with not enough sense not to walk in these woods.

The legends say that the god named Sollanium by the primitive races of this star system once created everything that the eye could see. However, the philosophy of Sollanium's Reach, central planet of the system, taught that something in the universe exists only when someone is looking at it. The great thing about this philosophy was that no one could prove it wrong, but no one could prove it right, either.

It used to be that this was the place in the universe where the stars were created. Massive clouds of star-making dust was floating around this area until enough of it stumbled upon itself to form a gravitational field which attracted more and more dust, thus creating a star. Nowadays, long after the last of the dust was spent, the stars come here to die, but the name stuck around.

Hikkaru people were once famous for their ingenious application of genetically modified plants for pretty much everything in their everyday lives - they grew food, but also houses and even tried to grow spaceships with which they could travel the stars. It was too late for them to realise that no plants could survive the cold indifference of space.

The planet Xandru, in the same-named system, was illuminated by a single white dwarf. Its weak light usually wasn't strong enough to hide the stars even during the day, and once a year it was completely covered by Xandru's unusually large moon. It casts a shadow over the planet which made a perfect cover for an ambush.

The ship was meant as a last bastion of hope for the Empire of Man. If everything else failed, this flying fortress the size of a minor planet would be the scene where the very last battle took place. It was designed so that nothing could penetrate its defense network of latest in weapon technologies. Or, so they thought.

Nishini were a proud race that took a lot of inspiration from a long-lost culture of a distant planet called Earth. They were amazed by the crude weapon called "katana" that was once used in war, and they modeled all their ships so that they resembled this medieval weapon. Nishini Battle Cruiser was no exception, and the culmination of Nishini technology in this ship proved it a deadly weapon as well.

The Orks are a race that was meant for war. Even from when they take their first steps, the youngs are taught of the beauty of war (or, how they would call it, "waaaagh!!!"), and are told of the countless battles throughout Ork history. To name a battle cruiser "Waagh Bringer" is thought to be among the highest of honors a ship-namer could bestow, and this one was quite aptly named.

Not many beings in this universe were brave enough to take up a merchant's position, risking life and limb (and a shipful of goods, which was far more important) to vast empty spaces and week-long trips from one planet to another. Pirate raids were not uncommon, but mostly merchant ships were taken as necessary casualties of war. The Frightful Merchant earned its name by fleeing any growing conflict, which turned to be quite a good philosophy - for it was the only large merchant ship still going strong in this galaxy.

Some planets had an unfortunate luck to become a centerpiece of some kind of a conflict. There were many of those throughout the billions of years the universe existed, but not one as violent as what is now commonly known as the Battle of Krenient. It was so horrifying that it completely flattened the entire surface of this planet, and even now, millions of years after the battle, nothing but a bit of brown grass grew on it.

An entire planet was a reference to a song by Sting. Inhabitants really love the guy. So much, actually, that they actually planted barley over the entire surface of the planet. They soon grew sick of it, though, and now they have no idea what to do with it, for no one wants to buy it, either.

The planet used to have a different name, but all records of it were destroyed. It was a political decision to rename the planet into something inviting, so it would trick the unassuming travelers to land on it and bring resources to a handful of inhabitants. In reality, not even meadows were present - just flat, brown dirt anywhere the eye could see.

Unusual six-legged beasts roamed the flat lands of this planet, almost never resting, but always traveling somewhere towards the horizon, as if trying to flee from something. Because of this, the scenery almost never changed and thus the planet earned its nickname.
